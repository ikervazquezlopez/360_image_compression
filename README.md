# 360_image_compression


This code takes the insights from the paper "*An Analysis on Pixel Redundancy Structure in Equirectangular Images*" [1] to vertically split the equirectangular image in two images and process each part independently to generate to romboids as in the paper "*Omnidirectional Video Coding Using Latitude Adaptive Down-Sampling and Pixel Rearrangement*" [2].


### To Do
- [X] Vertically split the image at latitude 0
- [X] Downsample both parts independently and generate two romboids (one per part)
- [ ] Rearrange the romboid pixels:
  - [] (1) Make them into triangles and fit them in the shame hemisphere
  - [X] (2) Use the same approach as in [2]
- [ ] Compute the quality metrics and compare against [2] results.
